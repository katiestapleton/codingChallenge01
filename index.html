Includes Bootstrap’s CSS file in the <head>
Width LARGER+: Has a bootstrap grid with 3 rows. The first has 3 columns, the second has 2 columns, and the 3rd row has 1 column

That same grid, when on a screen that is size Small or larger, shouldn’t have more than 2 columns per row.
Color the backgrounds of these divs with different colors so that each column can be seen.
(Optional, if time permits)  add an image to one of the columns and make it responsive. Add a Jumbotron above your 3 rows. Change the columns so that at screen width medium or larger, each column spans all 12 of the grid units.

Hint: to make a column behave one way when the screen is XL, you just give the div a class of col-xl-4 where the number (4 in this example) is a number of grid units out of 12 that the column should span.  To make that same column behave differently on a small screen, you could ALSO give it the class of col-sm-6, and now that same column on a small screen will span 6 of the 12 grid units. An example of the syntax is as follows:

<div class”col-xl-5 col-sm-7”>I am the content</div>
